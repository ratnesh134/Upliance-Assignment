## Data Analytics Project 

### Overview
This project analyzes datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. The aim was to extract actionable insights, create visualizations, and provide business recommendations.

### Dataset
Datasets Used The project leverages the following datasets:
UserDetails: Contains demographic and account information of users.
CookingSessions: Logs of user interactions during cooking sessions. OrderDetails: Information about orders placed by users.
and Order details for different users.

### Objectives:

Objectives Clean and merge datasets to prepare for analysis. Explore the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders.
Identify popular dishes and analyze demographic factors. Visualize insights and provide business recommendations. Key Findings-
 1.User Behavior Positive correlation between cooking sessions and order frequency. Peak user activity during evenings and weekends.
 2.Popular Dishes Top 10 dishes contributed significantly to both cooking sessions and orders. Preferences varied by demographics such as age group and location.
 3.Order Trends Orders peaked during weekends and festive seasons. Most orders contained 3-5 items.
 4.Demographics Users aged 25-34 were the most active across all datasets. High activity was observed in [top regions/cities]. Visualizations The project includes the following visualizations.

Scatterplots and line charts for time-based trends. Bar and pie charts for dish popularity and demographic preferences. 
Cohort analysis and funnel charts for retention and conversion rates. Business Recommendations Target High-Potential Users: Encourage conversion from sessions to orders using personalized offers. Promote Popular Dishes: Focus marketing efforts on top dishes for targeted demographics. Optimize Promotions: Schedule campaigns during peak hours and festive seasons. Improve Retention: Introduce loyalty programs and reactivation campaigns for inactive users. Tools and Technologies Python: Data cleaning, merging, and analysis. Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and processing. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization creation. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data analysis. GitHub: Version control and project management.
